# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-10-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:

- Help new team members understand the rationale behind key technical choices
- Provide context for future architectural changes
- Create a historical record of significant decisions
- Enable informed decision-making when revisiting past choices

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions.

ADRs will be:

- Stored in `docs/adr/` directory
- Numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Written in Markdown format
- Immutable once accepted (new ADRs supersede old ones rather than editing)
- Follow the structure: Title, Date, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Easy to understand the "why" behind technical choices
- Better onboarding experience for new team members
- Facilitates architectural discussions and reviews

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain
- Additional overhead when making architectural decisions
- Need to ensure ADRs stay up-to-date with actual implementation
